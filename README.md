# github_auto_upload_batch_file
This batch file automates the process of uploading files to GitHub from your local system. It navigates to your project folder, adds all changes, commits them with a message, and pushes to the main branch of your remote repository. Useful for quick updates, it requires Git to be installed and properly configured with remote URL.
